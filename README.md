# FauxFlux

Faux (made in imitation) Flux. A Flux Like Application Architecture for Building User Interfaces.


## Getting Started

FauxFlux relies on the wonderful MobX JS library - https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx 

```sh
npm install --save fauxflux mobx
```
FauxFlux also relies on Promises - supported in all major browsers besides IE


More documentation coming soon...


## Notice

Be warned! This codebase is still under active development so there are no guarantees the api is set in stone. Look for A v1.0.0 release in the near future.


## Demo
Todo MVC implementation using FauxFlux and [Incremental Dom](https://github.com/google/incremental-dom) ( [Demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/FauxFlux/fauxflux/46ff92d53477f9ce2bbc5bd9e6e3de4d18c50033/example/index.html) ). Much of the code was taken from [Pete Hunt's Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/) React example and modified to use the FauxFlux architecture design. The code for the demo can be viewed here - [example.js](/example/example.js)


## Todos

- [ ] Add documentation describing the architecture.
- [ ] Add tooling for better debugging.
